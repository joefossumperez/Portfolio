            <h1>P1R4T3B0X Studios; President & Founder</h1>
            <p>
                I have created this business from the ground up. In doing so, I had to learn many new skills along with their required applications. For example, I have to learn two new applications just to be able to create both the visuals for our project and the website as a whole. The applications I had to learn and apply in the creation of the website were Photoshop and WYSIWYG 17. This two applications alone, each require a learning curve taught through a bootcamp or college equivalent courses. The same goes for the applications I had to teach myself inorder to create the game that the website advertises. Such applications as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and more!

            <h1>IndieProof, LLC.</h1>
            <p>
                I founded IndieProof, LLC. in 2014. Our main product was an online platform I created geared towards independent film and its community.<a href="www.mytalentnetwork.com">MyTalentNetwork</a> was a one-stop-shop for indie filmmakers, actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, and all other professionals in the entertainment business. During development, I had to create and make things work without having any knowledge of coding at the time. I was able to do so first, by using a social media platform, <a href="https://www.phpfox.com">PHPFox</a>, as the core of MyTalentNetwork. Next, I had hired a few freelance coders from UpWork and Fivver to bring my platform to launch. We had a soft launch in the winter of 2015 followed closely by the release of our android app for the PlayStore.

            <h1>Solano Community College</h1>
            <p>
                After graduating high school in 2003, I wanted to stay close to home for a bit so I attended Solano Community College in Fairfield, California. Unfortunatly, I would be enrolled there longer than I had expected. By 2008, I would have obtained enough credits to qualify for an Associate's Degree and also to be able to transfer to a 4-year university of my choosing the following year.
