            <h1>P1R4T3B0X Studios; President & Founder</h1>
            <p>
                I have created this business from the ground up. In doing so, I had to learn many new skills along with their required applications. For example, I have to learn two new applications just to be able to create both the visuals for our project and the website as a whole. The applications I had to learn and apply in the creation of the website were Photoshop and WYSIWYG 17. This two applications alone, each require a learning curve taught through a bootcamp or college equivalent courses. The same goes for the applications I had to teach myself inorder to create the game that the website advertises. Such applications as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and more!

            <p>
                After graduating high school in 2003, I wanted to stay close to home for a bit so I attended Solano Community College in Fairfield, California. Unfortunatly, I would be enrolled there longer than I had expected. By 2008, I would have obtained enough credits to qualify for an Associate's Degree and also to be able to transfer to a 4-year university of my choosing the following year.
