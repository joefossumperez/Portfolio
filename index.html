                I have created this business from the ground up. In doing so, I had to learn many new skills along with their required applications. For example, I have to learn two new applications just to be able to create both the visuals for our project and the website as a whole. The applications I had to learn and apply in the creation of the website were Photoshop and WYSIWYG 17. This two applications alone, each require a learning curve taught through a bootcamp or college equivalent courses. The same goes for the applications I had to teach myself inorder to create the game that the website advertises. Such applications as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and more!
